## 🌳 Branch Strategy

| Branch | Purpose |
|--------|---------|
| `main` | Stable, production-ready code |
| `develop` | Integration branch for features |
| `feature/system-design` | System design examples and diagrams |
| `feature/cloud-observability` | Monitoring and observability implementation |
| `feature/security` | Security implementations and best practices |
| `feature/performance` | Performance profiling and optimization |
| `feature/documentation` | Technical blogs and guides |

**Workflow:** Feature → Pull Request → Code Review → Develop → Release → Main
