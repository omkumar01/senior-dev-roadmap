# 🚀 Miscellaneous Techs

> *Miscellaneous techs are always a bonus for dev if you have a good foundational knowledge of them*

---

### 🔄 GitHub Workflows
**Automate tasks in your repository using YAML-based workflows.** Essential for CI/CD pipelines, automated testing, and deployment automation.

### 🐳 Docker
**Containerization platform that packages applications with their dependencies.** Enables consistent deployment across different environments and is foundational for modern DevOps practices.

### ⚙️ Kubernetes
**Open-source container orchestration platform** for managing, scaling, and deploying containerized applications. Used for managing complex multi-container deployments in production.

### 📊 GraphQL
**Query language and runtime for APIs** that provides clients with the ability to request exactly the data they need. Offers more flexibility than traditional REST APIs.

### 🏗️ Microservices Architecture
**Architectural pattern** where applications are built as a suite of small, independent services that communicate over APIs. Improves scalability and team autonomy in large projects.

### 🔗 CI/CD Pipelines
**Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment practices** that automate testing, building, and deployment processes. Critical for modern software delivery.

### 📨 Message Queues (RabbitMQ, Kafka)
**Asynchronous communication systems** that decouple services and handle event-driven architectures. RabbitMQ for traditional queuing, Kafka for high-throughput event streaming.

### 💾 Redis
**In-memory data store** used for caching, session management, and real-time analytics. Significantly improves application performance.

### 🔍 ElasticSearch
**Powerful search and analytics engine** built on Lucene. Used for full-text search, log analysis, and complex data queries.

### 🌍 Terraform / Infrastructure as Code
**Tools for provisioning and managing infrastructure through code.** Enables reproducible, version-controlled infrastructure deployments.

### 📈 Monitoring & Observability (Prometheus, Grafana, DataDog)
**Tools for monitoring system health**, collecting metrics, and setting up alerts. Essential for maintaining production systems.

### 🖥️ Apache / Nginx
**Web servers** for serving static content and reverse proxying. Nginx is known for high performance and modern configurations.

### 📚 API Documentation (Swagger/OpenAPI)
**Standards for documenting APIs** in a machine-readable format. Improves developer experience and enables automatic client generation.
