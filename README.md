## 📌 Overview

This repository documents my 3-month roadmap to become a Senior Developer, including:

| Topic | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **🏗️ System Design** | Designing scalable, fault-tolerant systems. Learn architectural patterns, database design, caching strategies, and distributed system fundamentals. |
| **🧠 Data Structures & Algorithms** | Master core DSA concepts through LeetCode problems. Essential for technical interviews and writing optimized code. |
| **📊 Cloud-Native Observability** | Comprehensive monitoring, logging, and tracing for cloud applications. Understand metrics collection, distributed tracing, and alerting strategies. [*See More →*](miscellaneous.md) |
| **🔐 Security Best Practices** | Implement secure coding practices, API security, authentication/authorization, data encryption, and vulnerability management. |
| **👥 Leadership & Performance Engineering** | Develop soft skills, mentoring abilities, code optimization techniques, and performance profiling to guide teams effectively. |
